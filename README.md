<h2>ABOUT</h2>
This project will allow you to download a local copy of "Eat the Dungeon". The purpose of this project is to enable individuals to add custom content, change the function or balance of the game as they see fit or play the game offline.

<h2>HOW TO USE</h2>

You **MUST** have Node.js installed for this to work.<br>

You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).<br>
 <br>

0. Download the repo. Extract the folder somewhere.

1. Install Node.js. Click the link above and follow the installer. As written above, I suggest checking the box at the end to also install extra tools.

2. After installing Node, run INSTALL.bat. This will download the game.

3. After all is done in the previous step, hit RUN.bat. This should open a new tab in your web browser with the game loaded. **If it has nothing on it, try refreshing the page.**

<h2>FINAL NOTES</h2>

* That should be all! Now that you have a local copy you can modify or view any of the files for the game. To run the game again you **do not** need to use INSTALL again. Just hit RUN and it will relaunch the virtual server. 
* When you are done playing you can close the terminal spawned from RUN.
* I recommend making a local copy of the entire EatTheDungeon folder so that you don't need to redownload the game from the website to get a fresh copy if you decide to mess with the files. 
* Take care not to rename any files or move any directories unless you know how to change the scripts appropriately.

Do try to be responsible with this tool, as while it <b>shouldn't</b> place any more stress on the server than just playing the game, it very well might. Also, keep in mind the game _is_ bewildered_angel's intellectual property and should be handled appropriately with regard to redistribution.
