#ABOUT
This project will allow you to download a local copy of "Eat the Dungeon". It uses several js plugins and wget to scrape the site and then uses the http-server package to allow you to play it. The purpose of this project is to enable individuals to add custom content or change the function or balance of the game as they see fit.

#HOW TO USE

You **MUST** have Node.js installed for this to work.
In addition, you need wget.exe and put it in the main directory (with index.js and INSTALL.bat)

You can download Node.js from here:
(Windows / Mac) 
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
You can download wget from here (click the **EXE** option for either 32-bit or 64-bit):
(Windows)

1. After installing Node and placing wget.exe in the directory, run INSTALL.bat. This will download the game. This can take a *really* long time, so be patient! At some points it may appear frozen. This is *probably* not the case. It should take about twenty minutes to complete, but if it takes more than an hour to install the game on a normal internet connection then there may be a problem. Otherwise I advise to just wait it out.

2. After all is done in the previous step, hit RUN_GAME.bat. This should open a new tab in your web browser with the game loaded. If it has nothing on it try refreshing the page.


That should be all! Now that you have a local copy you can modify or view any of the files for the game. 

#NOTE
Do try to be responsible with this tool, as while it *shouldn't* place any more stress on the server than just playing the game, it very well might.
